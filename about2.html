               <p>We aim to provide a comprehensive, affordable resource for educational professionals in a world where the cost of education continues to rise. At OER Bookr, we also recognize that teachers are their own best resource for judging the textbook which would best fit their needs. That's why we leave it to you to rank books as you see fit. We believe that finances should never be a barrier to someone seeking to better themselves through education.</p>
